# Language of Fungi

In 11th grade I did a research project on the language of fungi. The aim of the project was to analyse the effect of an increased pH on the electical spiking activity in the mycelium of pleurotus ostreatus and pleurotus pulmonarius.

The results can be found in the resulting [paper](Die%20Sprache%20der%20Pilze.pdf) (only in German).

The inspiration for the project come from the work of ![Andrew Adamatzky](https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/AndrewAdamatzky).
